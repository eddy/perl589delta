Welcome to the perl589delta project!

This project exists to distribute the work involved with writing
the perl589delta.pod file for the 5.8.9 release of Perl.

Getting involved is easy.  You volunteer to handle a month's worth of
changelog (a chunk), and then write the relevant sections of the
perldelta for those changes, or as much as you can given the time you
have available.

This project uses git for change control.  You don't have to use
git to be a contributor, but it's encouraged.

The procedure for volunteering to take a chunk of work is:

    * If you want to work with the full git environment, register
      for an account on http://github.com/ .

    * Grab the latest copy of the repository.  With git you can
      use:

        git clone git://github.com/pfenwick/perl589delta.git 

      If you've got your commit-bit already, you can use:

        git clone git@github.com:pfenwick/perl589delta.git

      If you're working without git, you can download the master
      branch files at:

        http://github.com/pfenwick/perl589delta/tarball/master

    * Look at the Volunteers.txt file and select a free month.
      Send a note to pjf@cpan.org saying which month you're
      going to work on.  Paul will send you a commit bit, but
      you can start work without it.

    * Do all your work on the branch with your chunk number.  You
      can switch to yur branch with:

        git checkout 1970-01

      Replace 1970-01 with your chunk ID.

      If you're not using git, just make changes normally and
      send patches to pjf@cpan.org, who will apply them to your
      branch.

    * Work on your branch, not on the master.  The master branch
      is ONLY for completed chunks, and for shared resources such
      as the Volunteers file and helper programs.

    * When your chunk is COMPLETED, e-mail pjf@cpan.org to arrange
      for it to be merged into the master branch.

    * Feel warm and fuzzy about your contributions to Perl!
