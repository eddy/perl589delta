* Double-check B version number before final release -- PJF
* in 2006-10.txt, chage 29129 integrates 26400, '[PATCH] latest switch/say/~~'
  which doesn't make sense to me (switch/say/~~ is not in 5.8.9). Please
  re-check. --moritz
  * Nicholas Clark: "it's there because B is (notionally) dual life,
    so the B code is the same in all branches", he also stated it wasn't hugely
    noteworthy to include, but maybe this should be decided when 5.8.9 is
    released (p30363) --aflott
* I guess change 28879 (integrated in 30048) could be interesting, but so far
  I couldn't figure out what it actually does. --moritz
* Change 30046 integrates 'Subject: [perl #40239] New hints file for
  MidnightBSD'  which I don't know where to add. --moritz
* 29759 integrates 25953, which introduces a new header file. Should that be
  mentioned somehow? --moritz
* Don't know if and how 29721 -> 29138 should be mentioned --moritz
* Check that all the upgraded modules are actually correct -- PJF
* The optimized constant subs are in the source, but not used by 
  constant.pm (from NC) (p30355) --aflott
* Are ptar and ptardiff really out? They are in 5.10.0 --aflott
