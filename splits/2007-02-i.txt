	     and reintroduces an eval optimisation for innter runops levels
	     
	     [ 24363]
	     Better fix for #8738  (Core dump in 'leavetry')
	     When in an inner runops loop (eg via a tie or sort), an eval
	     needs a new JMPENV pushing by S_docatch. If an exception is raised,
	     control is returned to S_docatch, and it must determine whether
	     the eval that trapped the exception is an inner eval or an outer
	     one. In the former case, restart the loop, in the latter case,
	     rethrow the exception. This is determined by whether we are still
	     at the same PL_curstackinfo level. This fails in the case of
	     SPLICE(), which pushes a new SETJMP and runops level, but not a
	     new stackinfo level. There may be other code which does similar.
	     The solution is to store the current value of PL_top_env in each
	     pushed CxEVAL, and see if it's still the same as PL_top_env when
	     the exception is handled.

	     Rationalise the logic in lex_start for creating a new temporary if the
	     passed in SV is read only or doesn't end in ';'. Also, allow a NULL
	     pointer to imply a zero length string, which saves creating a mortal
	     in pp_require, only for it to be ignored in favour of a new SV.
