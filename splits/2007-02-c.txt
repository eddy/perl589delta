	     [ 29321]
	     Revert #29307. It doesn't fix the XXX after all. Using "$(shell @type )"
	     on a temporary file just inserts the contents of the file in question
	     into the command-line, exactly like putting the data there in the first
	     place would achieve. It doesn't avoid creating a long command-line as we
	     would like to do.

	     Fix for RT #7916: perl 5.6.1 with Intel's icc on RedHat 
	     Linux 7.2.	 The original fix, change #13053, added a check
	     for $Config{gccversion} which is now populated by newer
	     Intel compilers.  This additional change checks to see
	     if Intel is in $Config{gccversion}.  If it is, its not
	     a gcc.
