	     [ 30034]
	     newPADOP()'s sv parameter is never NULL, so mark it as so.
	     (Well, in theory it could be NULL if someone is creating ops during
	     symbol table destruction, but snowballs in hell, etc.
	     This is usually the point where Jarkko observes that the aliens are
	     looking for a free slot in their diaries...)

	     Change 30034 wasn't enough to silence the warnings - also need to
	     pass a never-NULL parameter to newPADOP from newGVOP
