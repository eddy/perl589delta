	     [ 29321]
	     Revert #29307. It doesn't fix the XXX after all. Using "$(shell @type )"
	     on a temporary file just inserts the contents of the file in question
	     into the command-line, exactly like putting the data there in the first
	     place would achieve. It doesn't avoid creating a long command-line as we
	     would like to do.

	     It already gets an icon when built with VC++, but the MinGW and Borland
	     builds were not making any use of the resource file.

	     Fix for RT #7916: perl 5.6.1 with Intel's icc on RedHat
