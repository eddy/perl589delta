	     SQL::Translator triggered a subtle piece of wrongness, whereby it
	     managed to cause a proxy constant subroutine in the symbol table to
	     be upgraded to a GV at precisely the point where it was being
	     considered as a possible IO handle name. The core's user-space visible
	     behaviour certainly was buggy - I believe this patch to be the correct
	     fix. However, it seems to be very hard to write a test for it.
