	     From: Slaven_Rezic via RT <bug-Storable@rt.cpan.org>

	     "The attached patch solves a possible failure in the croak.t
	     test. It seems that in some version Config.pm pre-loads Carp.pm,
	     causing the test to fail. The patch just makes sure that
	     Config.pm is only loaded when building Storable within core
	     perl."

	     Update the Storable changelog. Note that, while Storable's code is
	     in sync between the core and the CPAN, the tests are not.
